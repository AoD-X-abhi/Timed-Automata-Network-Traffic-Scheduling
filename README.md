### Features

- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling** – Urgent packets instantly preempt normal/low ones  
- **Timed Automata Engine** – Formal model with states, clocks, guards, and invariants  
- **Dynamic Deadlines via ML** – Gradient Boosting Regressor predicts per-packet deadlines  
- **Rule-Based + ML Hybrid Classifier** – Combines protoco<p align="center">
